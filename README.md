POS
---
The POS tab emulates a POS terminal and allows you to make sales of goods. Pressing the SCAN button simulates the reading of the product by a barcode scanner. In this case, the goods are selected in random order. You can change the quantity and price of a product by clicking the "..." button in the product line. You can also manually enter the desired barcode and immediately indicate the required quantity of goods. The generated check can be paid by pressing "PAY CHECK" or canceled by pressing "CLEAR CHECK".

BackOffice
----------
The BackOffice tab allows you to search, view, add, modify and delete goods. Also, there you can see what groups of goods and units of measurement of goods are.
